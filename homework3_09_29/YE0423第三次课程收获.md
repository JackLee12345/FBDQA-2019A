##**Lecture 3: Basic Strategies, Trader Blazer and Posterior Alpha Decomposition**

Learned the security selection factors like ROE_q, ROE_ttm; Learned how to design a stock pool;

Learned the design of choosing signal, like "MA3 goes up and through MA200";

Learned how to use trader blazer;

As for the posterior alpha decomposition, learned that the return of alphaP is irrelevant to the volatility of the overall market; Learned the "Alpha Strategy" which does not seek an accurate judgement of the trend of overall market, but seek a absolute positive return no matter the stock is up or down;

Got homework.
